    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of computational time that an algorithm takes to complete, as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm is one that runs in the least amount of time possible while still producing the correct result.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often denoted using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Understanding Space Complexity is crucial for optimizing programs to run within the memory constraints of a given system.</p>
